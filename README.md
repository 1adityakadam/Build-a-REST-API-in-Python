# Build a REST API in Python

This project demonstrates how to build a fully functional REST API in Python using Flask and SQLAlchemy. It covers everything from the basics of APIs to integrating a database and testing endpoints with Postman.

## What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) allows communication between a client (front-end) and a server (back-end).
This project implements a REST API (Representational State Transfer), which organizes resources into unique URIs and supports standard `CRUD operations`:

- POST → Create data

- GET → Read data

- PUT → Update data

- DELETE → Delete data

All interactions are handled with JSON payloads for cross-language compatibility.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3

- Flask → Lightweight framework for API routes

- Flask-SQLAlchemy → ORM to manage database models

- SQLite → Database backend

- Postman → API testing

## Setup Instructions

 ## Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your-username/build-rest-api-python.git
cd build-rest-api-python


## Create a virtual environment

python3 -m venv api_env
source api_env/bin/activate


## Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Run the app

python app.py


Your API will be live at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Database Model

The project uses a simple Destinations table:

Field	Type	Description
id	Integer	Primary key
destination	String	City or location name
country	String	Associated country
rating	Float	Rating score (1.0 - 5.0)

## API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/	Welcome message
GET	/destinations	Fetch all destinations
GET	/destinations/<id>	Fetch destination by ID
POST	/destinations	Add a new destination
PUT	/destinations/<id>	Update destination by ID
DELETE	/destinations/<id>	Delete destination by ID

## Testing with Postman

Open Postman and enter the API base URL:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


##Test requests:

GET /destinations → Returns all data in JSON.

POST /destinations with body:

{
  "destination": "Paris",
  "country": "France",
  "rating": 4.8
}


PUT /destinations/1 → Update entry with ID 1.

DELETE /destinations/1 → Remove entry with ID 1.
